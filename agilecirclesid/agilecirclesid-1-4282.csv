They didn't bother to inform they would not be attending so we don't know the reason. They have come to previous reviews.\n\nThis looks to me like a very serious problem. Is this team building a product nobody cares about? Are the users completely disengaged? What other possible explanations there are? \n\nHow can you deal with this?",24,10,2018,7,36,7,,,0,

256,0,"I was attending a webinar yesterday where it was discussed that sprint review should not be a mere demo showing all the features developed or showing the demo of all the stories worked upon. \n\nIt should rather focus on the outcome. Like the team should convey the users something like ....u (referring to the users)wanted to be able to do thing x in a better way like by spending less time in doing thing x. So we are going to show u the features which will help you to spend less time to do it. Have a look at it and tell us ur feedback, whether u think that these features can reduce the time spent on doing X. \n\nIts like focusing more on the outcomes and on the user's need rather than only focusing on all the work which the scrum team has done during the sprint",24,10,2018,12,15,56,,,0,

499,0,"Good morning. Does anyone have some reading materials about applying Scrum/Agile to a 1000+ person product development teams? Bukalapak is crossing that threshold next week, and the Spotify model is starting to show its age and inflexibility. We think it's time to transition to a new model.",15,11,2018,23,17,0,Ibrahim,Arief,0,iarief
500,0,What are the drawbacks of spotify for such large organization? What is not working?,15,11,2018,23,52,43,Hugo,Messer,0,
501,0,"Well, the foundational building blocks of the Spotify model is the concept of Squads (i.e. Scrum teams), right. Small, autonomous, cross-functional, and dedicated team of talents that work together to decide what ideas they want to build and then work together to turn those ideas into reality.\n\nThen there are additional structures on top of it such as Tribes, or alongside it such as Guilds, but the basic unit remains the same: Squads.\n\nWhat we found out as we scale up is that some percentage of the teams cannot generate ideas fast enough or impactful enough to give the engineers within that squad the same kind of impact as they could be in other, higher impact, squads.\n\nAnd conversely, from our high level point of view, we can see several high impact initiatives not being built fast enough because the number of talents that work on that initiative are limited to the size of a single squad, which is sometimes frustrating when we know that that initiative can actually deliver more impact than the impact of half dozen other squads.",16,11,2018,0,3,2,Ibrahim,Arief,0,iarief
502,0,"So we're thinking about gravitating towards the Amazon model, where the Product side and the Engineering side are fully decoupled and can run at their on paces, and the most scarce resources of all (i.e. engineers) can be continuously redeployed to higher impact Product ideas.\n\nWe can probably do this within the same tribe since we like that concept, but this decoupling breaks the Squad concepts of having dedicated talents to that cross-functional team.\n\nWe would also like to see what other models published out there for thousand-person-scale product development teams, there seems to be relatively scarce discussions at this level of scale.",16,11,2018,0,10,13,Ibrahim,Arief,0,iarief
503,0,I haven't heard of the Amazon model and it sounds a bit against what most Agile people would propose. Splitting product and it is counter agile manifesto? And moving people around is also countering the idea of stable teams? \n\nSounds like the main challenge is generating the most impactfull features. It sounds like this is a product challenge. Maybe it is about not having enough strong po? What's the source of most ideas in Bukalapak?,16,11,2018,0,16,1,Hugo,Messer,0,
504,0,"In terms of models, maybe less has some ideas worth adopting?",16,11,2018,0,16,24,Hugo,Messer,0,
505,0,My instinct says that the basis could be what u have. And u can add things to it from other best practices without fundamentally shifting to a whole new model?,16,11,2018,0,17,15,Hugo,Messer,0,
506,503,"True about the Amazon model, especially about moving people around makes it a very dynamic environment. I named it such just because I gathered it from the talks I had with ex-Amazon managers & engineers within Bukalapak.\n\nIdeas flow from everywhere, mostly from customer/user research and from the squads themselves. But the cycle time between an ideas being written down in detail and seeing it live in production is very fast, within 2-3 weeks in average. Overall we deliver about 350 increments to production every week.\n\nThus we occasionally see the product side getting a bit overwhelmed and cannot generate ideas fast enough. Splitting them into smaller squads is sometimes an option, but right now we're already at 70+ squads.\n\nBut there's also the other, and IMO more pressing, side of the challenge: when we have large impact stories (which usually carries large complexities) we are locked to just a small amount of people within a single squad that can work on it.",16,11,2018,0,37,10,Ibrahim,Arief,0,iarief
507,504,"I've been checking less before, but the impression I got was that it was designed for a smaller size of teams than ours, like around fifty to maybe a couple hundred people in the development group. We've survived that scale well enough by the Spotify model, but now we're treading a new ground at a different level altogether.",16,11,2018,0,39,40,Ibrahim,Arief,0,iarief
508,505,"Agree, I like gradual and incremental changes too while still preserving the existing model if possible, while measuring the impact at every step along the way, so right now we're still looking for ideas pick up and transition through for the next six months or so.",16,11,2018,0,41,21,Ibrahim,Arief,0,iarief
509,507,"Hmm, I take my words back, last time I was reviewing their case studies where the team size on those cases were around a couple hundred at most, but checking their principles page it seems like they're claiming working models for 1000-person group too.",16,11,2018,0,50,0,Ibrahim,Arief,0,iarief
510,508,The spotify model has grown beyond tribe. They have created higher level interface. Maybe to handle bigger scale story just like in your case,16,11,2018,0,52,11,Rifki,,0,Rifkiri

517,506,"I think it's about solving the main bottlenecks. Reading this it sounds like u need more product owners. Or find ways to make them more productive, easier ways to prioritize or make user stories, etc. \nAnd for squads. I think for a large feature, the user stories could be split between 2 or more squads?",16,11,2018,1,20,27,Hugo,Messer,0,
518,517,"Can’t agree more with Hugo. I also want to go to older wisdom, it’ll help to identify where this potential bottleneck happened if you’re able to visualize your value stream across tribe and squads and gain more understanding on how your system at scale works",16,11,2018,1,39,49,,,0,

520,517,increasing number of teams involved in a single story also meant exponentially increasing the complexity of the efforts necessary though since we then need to sync the roadmap of multiple teams 😄,16,11,2018,2,54,45,Ibrahim,Arief,0,iarief
521,518,"look, I appreciate the inputs, but I think the focus is slightly off center atm.\n\nthe main concern is not about resolving bottlenecks in the product side, but rather on what kind of structure that enable more than a squad's worth of talents work on high-impact stories/epics.",16,11,2018,3,7,13,Ibrahim,Arief,0,iarief
522,0,"when we're still at a hundred-person scale, a single squad represents 10%-15% of our product development talents, so high-impact initiatives being driven by this sizable chunk still represents a proportional and efficient deployment of our talents.\n\nbut when we're at a thousand-person scale, a single squad represents less than 1.5% of our entire product development talents.",16,11,2018,3,7,21,Ibrahim,Arief,0,iarief
523,0,"to be clear, having so many squads working in parallel and supporting them with the right autonomous structure is amazing for product development and I really love the kind of overall velocity we can deliver, as shown by our 350 increments per week shipped to production.\n\nbut when a high-impact stories/epics came along, and it took a single squad 2-3 months to finish and deliver it to production rather than our usual 2-3 weeks for average stories, surely we can do better in terms of a working model to have more talents beyond a single squad working on building these high-impact stories/epics.",16,11,2018,3,7,53,Ibrahim,Arief,0,iarief

624,0,"""We are used to thinking in classic classical thinking about planning a project, then gradually implementing the whole project, while in the digital age there is a completely different kind of approach and the applications have to be introduced step by step. This right thinking in implementing the Citizen Portal will be very important. We will introduce the first functions, namely those of the federal government - that is more than 100 - very quickly. We will then enforce the other 400 features with the countries, so that by the end of 2022, we can truly create complete and complete access - from vehicle registration to parental allowance application, tax return, health records and many, many other things. It is necessary . This is not a nerd project, as you might say; because if citizens do not get this access, we will not survive in the digital age.

1422,0,Hence the career path will be irrelevant of hierarchy of org structure,18,5,2019,2,5,12,Rifki,,0,Rifkiri
1423,0,"Just like doctors, they have career path but no structure",18,5,2019,2,5,41,Rifki,,0,Rifkiri
1424,0,yeah so you can develop capabilities and develop skills/knowledge/experience and be rewarded for that within an organization,18,5,2019,2,11,59,Hugo,Messer,0,
1425,0,But what with the need of people for power? And status?,18,5,2019,2,12,12,Hugo,Messer,0,
1426,1425,I think it depends on the type of industry. I have seen that flat type management does not really work in manufacturing with large number of workers. The key thing is functional management may fit in one industry but not in industry that fast changing such in tech industry.,19,5,2019,6,33,1,Fandi,Gunawan,0,
1427,1419,"I don't think it's a matter of fast growth or sidestepping established management principles.\n\neven bol.com, which was a 12-year old e-commerce with quite a lengthy list of established corporate cultures and practices when I worked over there, had a rule where 50% of members within an agile team must be shuffled around every year to avoid stagnation.\n\nit's about recognizing that tech talents suffer from boredom when being presented with the same kind of challenge over and over again, potentially stunting their personal growth, and prioritizing those growth over gains from team stability.",19,5,2019,6,40,27,Ibrahim,Arief,0,iarief

1464,0,may i post a question here? There is something that i need to ask regarding scrum,26,5,2019,13,16,38,Badie'ah,Assegaf,0,
1465,1464,Of course. that's what the group is for,26,5,2019,13,25,35,Hugo,Messer,0,
1466,0,"we know that sprint has definition of ""done"". From what i believe, one or more backlog items will be declared as ""done"" if they meet the acceptance criteria and the entire team agreed with that.

1473,0,what if we have a condition when we  run out of time and we realized that we cant satisfy the DoD? shall we put the task back to the backlog list and rework it sometime in the future sprint?,27,5,2019,2,33,2,Badie'ah,Assegaf,0,
1476,0,"thanks for the answer @antmarsh . But i have another question, if you dont mind 😉",27,5,2019,2,37,45,Badie'ah,Assegaf,0,
1478,0,"Let say that we have consistent duration for each sprint (Eg 2-week sprint). But somehow, on one of the sprints, the team can finish it in 1 week. so we still have 1 week left in the sprint. What should we do with the rest of the time? do we have to determine the length of the next sprint? or what?",27,5,2019,2,46,19,Badie'ah,Assegaf,0,
1485,1484,of course 😂,27,5,2019,2,52,55,Badie'ah,Assegaf,0,

Hasil survei akan aku sebar minggu depan ke grup-grup agile di WA & Telegram (seperti Agile Indonesia, Scrum Chapter X, Agile Circle Indonesia).\n\nAkhir pekan ini (14-15 Sept), surveinya sudah tidak bisa diisi lagi. Jadi, jangan tunda-tunda ya...\n\nPertanyaannya cuma 12 yes/no question kok -- isian untuk curhat lebih detail-nya opsional.\n\nJadi, jujurlah & curhat yang banyak 🙃. Karena anonim 100% surveinya. 😎\n\nBerikut 12 pertanyaan di sana:\n\n===\n\n1. Apakah ada satu orang pengambil keputusan yang jelas, yang bisa menentukan fitur-fitur apa saja yang akan dibuat?\n\n2. Apakah si pengambil keputusan tersebut (jika ada) intens bertemu langsung & bisa mudah dihubungi tim pengembang?\n\n3. Apakah menurut kamu, rilis pertama dari produk (atau fitur besar) seringkali masih bisa diperkecil? Yang berarti rilis pertamanya bisa dipercepat sebenarnya?\n\n4. Setelah rilis yang pertama tersebut, apakah biasanya dilanjutkan dengan rilis yang rutin & sering?\n\n5. Apakah pihak bisnis menyiapkan data-data empirik terkait pengguna sebelum datang dengan permintaan fitur baru?\n\n6. Apakah keluhan pengguna intens didengar & bisa langsung mengubah arah pembuatan produk?\n\n7. Apakah tim internal rutin mengevaluasi & memperbaiki cara mereka memahami pengguna?\n\n8. Apakah tim pengembang rutin mengevaluasi & memperbaiki cara mereka mengembangkan software?\n\n9. Apakah kondisi terkini pekerjaan tim pengembang selalu bisa dilihat oleh semua pihak?\n\n10. Apakah tim pengembang dilobi untuk 'berkerja lebih cepat' / 'mengambil kerjaan lebih banyak' saat mengestimasi pekerjaan?\n\n11. Apakah tim pengembang punya standar kualitas kerja tertentu, sehingga bug jadi minim dan kode mereka tetap terjaga untuk mudah dipahami?\n\n12. Apakah tim pengembang diberi ruang untuk meningkatkan standar kualitas pekerjaan mereka?\n\n===\n\nYuk isi -> https://forms.gle/BUQPQAggXumSLBkZ9\n\nBiar kita sama-sama tahu 'khas'-nya tangkas ala Indonesia 😊",10,9,2019,13,52,28,RizkySyaiful.github.io,,0,RizkySyaiful

You need visualization and reporting that keeps everyone in the whole chain updated. \n\nThe frameworks they describe all have their answers to that coordination mechanism. You can also create your own house blend.",17,9,2019,22,43,9,Hugo,Messer,0,

But, the slide before this about ""manage dependencies among cross-team"" is one of of the answer how we can tranform. Because, based on my experience, the hardest part to make this happened is not about what framework what we want to use, but the mindset it self, how to implementing agile values between people across the bank.

If we start doing that, if we do our job well, it will grow in popularity (and thus it will become 'adopted' and their statistics show that they have x % in Indonesian market).

2567,0,"Bismillah.. pengumuman, pengumuman,,\n\nDengan ini, saya resmi meluncurkan Tiga Pilar Agile ( https://3pillarsofagile.github.io/ ).\n\nRay Rizaldy, CEO gits.co.id, kurang-lebih bilang ini di meetup 2 hari lalu, ""Saya ga menaruh kata 'Agile' di slide. Saya sedang detox 'Agile'. Kata 'Agile' udah jadi buzzword.""\n\nI feel you Rey. I do agree.\n\nKata 'Agile' populer, tapi semua orang punya definisi-nya sendiri2. Banyak yang curiga 'Agile' itu cuma bungkus baru konsultan agar jualnnya cepat laku. Tidak sedikit yang memakai 'Agile' untuk 'memecut' pegawainya berkerja lebih cepat.\n\nDengan Tiga Pilar Agile, mari kita kembalikan kata 'Agile' ke makna aslinya: 'tangkas'. Ya! Sesederhana itu.\n\nJangan lupakan sejarah.\n\nKata 'Agile' adalah hasil rembukan para penemu-penemu proses kerja revolusioner di tahun 90-an. Bagi mereka, kata 'Agile' atau 'tangkas', adalah yang paling pas untuk jadi benang merah proses-proses kerja ciptaan mereka. Sumber: https://agilemanifesto.org/history.html\n\nMaka, pemahaman 'Agile' yang benar, terletak di dalam proses-proses kerja mereka (DSDM, Scrum, dan XP). Kalau kita lihat, isi tiap proses itu ya praktik-praktik kerja. Menariknya, semua praktiknya bisa kita golongkan ke tiga kata sifat pecahan dari 'tangkas' itu sendiri. Yaitu:\n\n1. Cepat\n2. Fleksibel\n3. Tidak mudah jatuh\n\n(Pejamkan mata. Bayangkan binatang-binatang yang tangkas. Apakah mereka memiliki ketiga sifat di atas?)\n\nKetiga-nya harus ada. Agile bukan sekedar 'cepat'.\n\nJangan mengaku agile, **kalau tidak rilis-rilis, tidak intens mendengar keluhan/ide pengguna/rekan-kerja, atau tidak rutin retrospektif. Karena Anda tidak fleksibel.**\n\nJangan mengaku agile, **kalau tim developer dicekoki deadline dari atas, atau dipaksa mengorbankan fase testing & kerapihan kode demi rilis cepat. Karena Anda akan mudah sekali jatuh di masa depan.**\n\nJadi agile itu apa? Agile itu bahasa Indonesianya tangkas. Tangkas itu gabungan dari cepat, fleksibel, dan tidak mudah jatuh.\n\nMau organisasi kamu jadi lebih tangkas? Terapkan praktik-praktik ketangkasan -- NAMUN HARUS mewujudkan ketiga sifat tersebut tanpa pengecualian. Ada banyak di internet. Salah satunya bisa belajar di Tiga Pilar Agile https://3pillarsofagile.github.io/.\n\nAkhir kata, saya setuju dengan Ray, 'Agile' itu kata buzzword.\n\nTapi saja juga percaya, 'tangkas' (atau 'agile') itu, bukan buzzword. 'Tangkas' adalah kata sifat yang abadi -- dan amat relevan di era transformasi digital ini.\n\n---\n\nSelasa depan (15 Oktober 2019), Tiga Pilar Agile mengadakan kelas gratis di Jakarta. Tajuknya, ""Penyelarasan Pemahaman Agile di Organisasi"" -> https://www.instagram.com/p/B3ZPLcGh1FD/\n\nBaca ini untuk lihat testimoni peserta di kelas sebelumnya -> https://3pillarsofagile.github.io/workshop/2019-09-10-pengenalan-ke-organisasi.html\n\nDaftar di t.me/kelasGratis3PA",11,10,2019,4,40,42,RizkySyaiful.github.io,,0,RizkySyaiful

Here, I will be posting several Quantitative and Aptitude questions with proper explanation and practice problems related to linked lists, binary trees, strings and array and other data structures and algorithms. Dynamic programming which is one of the most important and most ignored part of programming. I will be focusing more on these problems. \n\nMost of the big tech companies filter candidates in the first round which is often Q&A and online coding round. Getting through this round is also often the toughest part. \n\nI'll be posting all the questions which either I have been asked in several interviews or which I think can be asked. \n\nJust check out the posts in your leisure time and ensure a steady learning of new concepts and brush up the older ones.\n\nDo join our telegram channel t.me/codingturf4you",28,10,2019,8,49,40,RJ,,0,iamrj846
